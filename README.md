constructionsite
================

Hi,

I am thinking to create an application for helping building, residents, etc constructors and their respective suppliers (who would be providing resources required to construct buildings like cement, bricks, etc) to coordinate with each other. The suppliers will list out the materials along with their prices (based on location, market situation etc) and constructors will able to choose appropiate suppliers based on theri budget. Many more features can be added like constructors will list out their current projects and suppliers may bid on those, rating, commenting, etc. 

For this, I am thinking to use Spring MVC framework with hibernate technology. Please comment on the concept and approach.
